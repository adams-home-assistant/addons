# Secure Shell Remote Management

An SSH addon optimised for remote management.

The addon allows you to remotely manage your home assistant box, using popular Continuous Integration (CI), infrastructure as code, automation, configuration management techniques. The ethos is to treat your home assistant machine as [cattle, not a pet](https://www.google.com/search?q=cattel+vs+pet).

## Installation

Similar to other home assitant addons, but first you need to add adam's repository

1. Go to home **Supervisor** -> **Add-on store** -> **â‹®** -> **Repositories** and add the `https://github.com/adams-home-assistant/addons` repository.
1. Back in the Add-on store you should see "Home Assistant Addons from Adam"; under this click on **Home Assistant Addons from Adam**
1. Click **INSTALL**.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
authorized_keys:
  - "ssh-rsa ABC123...== your-key"
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `authorized_keys`

Your public keys that you wish to accept for login. You can authorize multiple keys by adding multiple public keys to the list.

If you get errors when adding your key, it is likely that the public key you're trying to add, contains characters that intervene with YAML syntax. Try enclosing your key in double quotes to avoid this issue.
