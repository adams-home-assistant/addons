# Adam's Home Assistant Addons

Currently only one addon :-)

## Secure Shell Remote Management

An SSH addon like the core [Terminal & SSH](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/tree/master/ssh) and the community [SSH & Web Terminal](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh) addons, but optimised for remote management via techniques like direct **ssh** commands, **git** or **ansible**.

See [here](./ssh_remote/).
